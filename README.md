## 🚀 Overview

**Data Aggregation Service** is a backend that aggregates, caches, and streams **live token data** from decentralized exchanges like **DexScreener** and **GeckoTerminal**.  
It exposes both **REST APIs** and **WebSocket streams** for clients to receive continuously updated token analytics in real time.

### 💡 Why it’s useful
- Combines data from multiple DeFi APIs into one unified interface.
- Broadcasts live token updates every 15 seconds.
- Caches results in Redis for performance and fault tolerance.
- Tested, modular, and production-ready — ideal for scaling analytics dashboards or bots.
